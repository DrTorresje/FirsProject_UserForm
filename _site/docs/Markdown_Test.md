# Here we go again
## 1 1/2 hours spent on git add vs. git commit 
30 min to learn that is better to turn on auto save. 
## I just wanted to get started with Markdown
now I am almost 1 hour in and still cannot begin. Lerning how to save, stage, commit aaaaand push changes. This is indeed the bottom of the learning curve.
